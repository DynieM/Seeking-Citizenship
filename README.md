## What It Does
Seeking Citizenship is a web-based application that simplifies the naturalization process of becoming a U.S. citizen by guiding the user step by step through documentation while providing tips and resources. It also promotes building community and support groups by encouraging individuals to connect with others going through similar processes via social forums.

## Motivation
This project was worked on during ShellHacks 2022, the largest hackathon in Florida, over a course of 48 hours in a group of 4. I played the role of Front-End.

## Features
- Selecting a langauge to manuever the application in.
- Navigation menu that leads the user to each step.
- Government resources and tips are provided to the user for the interview stage.
- A social forum that creates community and connection with other users going through the same process.

## Technologies Used
We used common front-end development languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap as a framework.
